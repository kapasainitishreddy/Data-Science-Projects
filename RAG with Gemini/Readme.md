## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an advanced technique that enhances the capabilities of generative AI models. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG combines document retrieval with generative AI to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

### How RAG Works:
1. **Retrieval**: The system first retrieves relevant information from external sources (e.g., documents, databases, or vector stores) based on the userâ€™s query.
2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved data is then fed into the generative AI model to provide additional context.
3. **Generation**: The generative model uses both the retrieved data and its pre-trained knowledge to generate a coherent and informative response.

RAG is especially useful in scenarios where you need up-to-date or specialized information that the model might not have seen during its training.

## Technologies Used

1. **Gemini Pro (Google Generative AI)**:
   - A powerful large language model by Google that is capable of generating human-like responses to queries.
   - In this project, **Gemini Pro** is used for text generation, augmenting its responses with information retrieved from external sources.

2. **Google Generative AI Embeddings**:
   - Embeddings are vector representations of text data. They allow the AI to understand the semantic meaning of the text and find similar or relevant content.
   - In this project, **Google Generative AI Embeddings** are used to convert documents and queries into vectors that can be compared and searched efficiently.

3. **Chroma (Vector Store)**:
   - **Chroma** is a vector store that holds vectorized representations of documents. It enables fast and efficient similarity searches based on vector embeddings.
   - In this project, Chroma is used to store document embeddings and retrieve relevant information for augmentation.

4. **LangChain**:
   - **LangChain** is a framework that simplifies the integration of language models with external data sources and document retrieval systems.
   - It allows us to set up the **retriever** and the **QA chain** (question-answering chain) that combines document retrieval with AI generation.

By using these technologies, the project combines the generative power of the **Gemini Pro** model with real-time document retrieval, allowing for more accurate and context-aware responses.
